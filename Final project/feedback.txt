Feedback - Vault of Codes Internship Project

Working on this project was a great learning experience. I got hands-on practice with Python, 
Tkinter for GUI design, and external libraries like Wikipedia API. I also improved my problem-solving 
skills while fixing installation issues and debugging errors.

Challenges:
- Faced issues with pip and multiple Python versions.
- Needed to experiment with both console and GUI versions of the assistant.
- Had to learn how to style Tkinter windows for a modern look.

Learning Outcomes:
- Learned to design a menu-driven assistant in Python.
- Gained experience in creating a Tkinter-based graphical interface.
- Understood how to integrate external libraries and APIs.
- Improved my debugging and troubleshooting skills.

Future Scope:
- Adding speech recognition so users can talk to the assistant.
- Adding a chatbot-like interface.
- Deploying it as a simple web application using Flask or Streamlit.

Overall, I really enjoyed building this AI Assistant and it helped me 
strengthen both my coding and project development skills.
